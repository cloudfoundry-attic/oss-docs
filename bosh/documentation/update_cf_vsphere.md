# Update Cloud Foundry Deployment Using Bosh #

This document helps you to update the Cloud Foundry Deployment with a new release. We will upload a new Cloud Foundry release, configure the deployment manifest, and run: `bosh deploy`

Note: Target should be set to BOSH Director (which was set while deploying Cloud Foundry). You can check it by running following command:
+ `bosh status`

Output of the above command is similar to listing below:

          $ bosh status
            Updating director data... done

            Director
            Name      dev124
            URL       http://192.168.9.24:25555 # BOSH Director IP address
            Version   0.6 (release:15efc489 bosh:441aa172)
            User      admin
            UUID      1936f9dc-d9ff-429a-a334-8d8001b0ba21
            CPI       vsphere

            Deployment
             Manifest  /home/rajdeep/cloudfoundry_2/deployments/cf/cloudfoundry.yml
       

If it is not set to BOSH director then follow the steps on this link to set it to BOSH DIRECTOR:
[Deploy Cloud Application Platform - Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/documentation/deploy_cf_vsphere.md)

## Get Latest Cloud Release ##

To get the Latest Release, go to the release folder and run 'update' command as follows:

1. `cd cf-release`
2. `./update`

Now upload the new release as follows:

+ `bosh upload release releases/appcloud-119.yml`

You'll see a flurry of output as BOSH configures and uploads release components. 

For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll use a sample [deployment manifest](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/tutorial/examples/dev124.yml)

Keep in mind that a manifest of this size requires significant virtual hardware resources to run.

Use the BOSH CLI to set your current deployment. If you placed your deployment manifest yml in `~/cloudfoundry/deployments/cf`, run the following command: 

+ `bosh deployment ~/cloudfoundry/deployments/cf/cloudfoundry.yml` 

## Deploy ##

Let's summarize what we accomplished in this section. 

+ We uploaded the new release to the Director
+ Configured a deployment manifest
+ Set the deployment manifest as the current deployment using the BOSH CLI. 

Now execute the deploy command from BOSH CLI:


+ `bosh deploy`

Output of the above command is pretty long and is partially listed below;

        $ bosh deploy 
          Getting deployment properties from director...
          Compiling deployment manifest...
          Detecting changes in deployment...

          Release
          changed version:
          - 106
          + 119
          Release version has changed: 106 -> 119
          Are you sure you want to deploy this version? (type 'yes' to continue): yes


If you'd like to learn more about what happens during the deployment process, read the official documentation's [explanation of a deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/documentation/documentation.md#bosh-deployments).


# Verification #

Now we need to verify, that all our VMs and application working fine after the update. 

Run the following command to verify that all VMs are running:

+ `bosh vms`

Output of the above command is similar to listing below:

	$ bosh vms
	Deployment `cloudfoundry'
	
	Director task 30
	
	Task 30 done
