          $ bosh delete stemcell bosh-stemcell 0.6.4
            Checking if stemcell exists...
            You are going to delete stemcell `bosh-stemcell/0.6.4'
            Are you sure? (type 'yes' to continue): yes

            Director task 44

            Deleting stemcell from cloud 

+ Once stemcell is deleted,the deployment target should be set to Micro BOSH.

+ Execute following command to get the name of BOSH deployment:

 `bosh deployments`
   
   Output of the above command is similar to listing below:

        $ bosh deployments

          | Name | Release(s) | Stemcell(s)         |
          +------+------------+---------------------+
          | bosh | bosh/10    | bosh-stemcell/0.6.4 |
          +------+------------+---------------------+

 `bosh delete deployment bosh`

Output of the above command is partially listed below:

        $bosh delete deployment bosh 

         You are going to delete deployment `bosh'.
