Introduction
============

This tutorial will guide you through the process of deploying a multi-tier WordPress installation using BOSH. Due to its simplicity, WordPress is a good way to learn BOSH, but it is not meant to represent a realistic use case.

Prerequisites
==========

A working BOSH director

# Installing BOSH on an Ubuntu VM #

## Install Ruby via rbenv ##

1. BOSH is written in Ruby. Let's install Ruby's dependencies

		sudo apt-get install git-core build-essential libsqlite3-dev curl libmysqlclient-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libpq-dev

1. Get the latest version of rbenv

		cd
		git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git .rbenv

1. Add `~/.rbenv/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to the `rbenv` command-line utility

		echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

1. Add rbenv init to your shell to enable shims and autocompletion

		echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile

1. Download Ruby 1.9.2

		wget http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.2-p290.tar.gz

1. Unpack and install Ruby

		 tar xvfz ruby-1.9.2-p290.tar.gz
		 cd ruby-1.9.2-p290
		 ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.rbenv/versions/1.9.2-p290
		 make
		 make install

1. Restart your shell so the path changes take effect

		source ~/.bash_profile

1. Set your default Ruby to be version 1.9.2

		rbenv global 1.9.2-p290

## Install Local BOSH and BOSH Releases ##

1. Sign up for an account on the Cloud Foundry public Gerrit server at [http://reviews.cloudfoundry.org/](http://reviews.cloudfoundry.org/)

1. Generate an ssh public key (accept all defaults)

		ssh-keygen -t rsa
		
1. Copy your key from `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` into your Gerrit account
 
1. Set your name and email

                git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
                git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

		
1. Install our gerrit-cli gem:

                gem install gerrit-cli
                rbenv rehash

1. Clone BOSH repositories from Gerrit

                gerrit clone ssh://reviews.cloudfoundry.org:29418/bosh-sample-release.git
                gerrit clone ssh://reviews.cloudfoundry.org:29418/cf-release.git
                gerrit clone ssh://reviews.cloudfoundry.org:29418/bosh.git
		
1. Run some rake tasks to install the BOSH CLI

		cd ~/bosh
		rake bundle_install (Note: if this fails run 'gem pristine rake' and retry)
		cd cli
		bundle exec rake build
		gem install pkg/bosh_cli-x.x.x.gem

## Deploy to your BOSH Environment ##

With a fully configured environment, we can begin deploying the sample application to our environment. As listed in the prerequisites, you should already have an environment running, as well as the IP address of the BOSH Director. Ask your BOSH technical contact for help if you need it.

### Point BOSH at a Target and Clean your Environment ###

1. Target your director (this IP is an example - replace with yours!) 

		bosh target 192.168.1.99:25555 

1. Check the state of your BOSH settings.

		bosh status
		
1. The result of your status will be akin to:

		Target         targetname (http://198.1621.99:25555) Ver: 0.3.12 (01169817)
		UUID           #####hex-uuid-goes-here-############
		User           admin
		Deployment     not set

1. If you have previously used this BOSH director you may have existing deployments and releases.  List previous deployments (we will remove them in a moment)
    
		bosh deployments

1. If you have any existing deployments `bosh deployments` will show something like:

		+---------+
		| Name    |
		+---------+
		| example |
		+---------+

1. Delete any existing deployments (ex: example) 

		bosh delete deployment example 

1. Answer `yes` to the prompt and wait for the deletion to complete

1. List previous releases (we will remove them in a moment)

		`bosh releases`

1. If you have  result of `bosh releases` should be akin to:

		+--------+----------+
		| Name	 | Versions |
		+--------+----------+
		| myapp  | 1, 2, 3  |
		+--------+----------+
		
1. Delete the existing releases (ex: myapps) 

		bosh delete release myapp 

1. Answer `yes` to the prompt and wait for the deletion to complete

### Create a Release ###

1. Change directories into bosh-sample-release:

		cd ~/bosh-sample-release
	
	This directory contains the sample WordPress deployment and release files. 

1. Reset your environment

		bosh reset release

1. Answer `yes` to the prompt and wait for the environment to be reset

1. Create a release

		bosh create release --force --with-tarball
		
1. Answer `wordpress` to the `release name` prompt

1. Your terminal will display information about the release including the Release Manifest, Packages, Jobs, and tarball location.

1. Open `bosh-sample-release/wordpress.yml` in your favorite text editor and confirm that `name` is `wordpress` and `version` matches the version that was displayed in your terminal (if this is your first release, this will be version 1).

### Deploy the Release ###


1. Upload the WordPress example Release to your Environment

		bosh upload release dev_releases/wordpress-1.tgz
		
1. Your terminal will display information about the upload, and an upload progress bar will reach 100% after a few minutes.

1. Open `bosh-sample-release/wordpress.yml`.  You will need to edit several things to match your environment.  You should update director_uuid, any VLANs, the IPs under networks, dns servers and any static ips listed for specific jobs.  An example manifest is in the Appendix.

1. Deploy the Release

		bosh deploy
		
1. Your deployment will take a few minutes.

1. Copy the URL for your WordPress installation from the `properties.wordpress.servername` value in `wordpress.yml`

1. Browse your WordPress blog at this URL.

1. Complete the form to install your WordPress blog
