# Python support in Cloud Foundry OSS

## Python Support

**Python support is only available in an OSS vcap setup from [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap) or [ActiveState Stackato](http://www.activestate.com/stackato). It is not available yet in CloudFoundry.com or Micro Cloud Foundry.** 

Python applications are supported through the WSGI protocol. Gunicorn is used as the web server serving WSGI applications, including Django. Non-Django applications must have a top-level wsgi.py exposing an application variable that points to a WSGI application.

## Installing dependencies using pip

Python package prerequisites of your application can be defined in a top-level 
requirements.txt file (see [format documentation](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/requirement-format.html)), 
which file is used by pip to install dependencies.

### Limitations

  * Package dependencies are never cached, and they will be downloaded (and installed) every time your app is updated or restarted.

## Django support

A special framework called "Django" exists to also perform Django-specific staging actions. At the moment, this runs syncdb non-interactively to initialize the database.

### Accessing the database

Cloud Foundry makes the service connection credentials available as JSON via the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable. Using this knowledge, you can use the following snippet in your own settings.py:

    # Pull in CloudFoundry's production settings  
    if 'VCAP_SERVICES' in os.environ:  
        import json  
        vcap_services = json.loads(os.environ['VCAP_SERVICES'])  
        # XXX: avoid hardcoding here  
        mysql_srv = vcap_services['mysql-5.1'][0]  
        cred = mysql_srv['credentials']  
        DATABASES = {  
            'default': {  
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',  
                'NAME': cred['name'],  
                'USER': cred['user'],  
                'PASSWORD': cred['password'],  
                'HOST': cred['hostname'],  
                'PORT': cred['port'],  
            }  
        }  
    else:  
        DATABASES = {  
            "default": {  
                "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",  
                "NAME": "dev.db",  
                "USER": "",  
                "PASSWORD": "",  
                "HOST": "",  
                "PORT": "",  
            }  
        }

### Limitations

  * Django admin (if your app uses it) will be unusable as superusers are not created due to running syncdb non-interactively.
  * Migration workflow, such as that of [South](http://south.aeracode.org/) are not supported.

## VMC

To discover and use Python support, you need VMC version _0.3.14_ or higher:
    
    $ vmc -v
    vmc 0.3.16.beta.5
    
    # to upgrade to the latest version:
    $ gem update vmc

## Sample Applications

Sample applications are available at [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap-test-assets/tree/master/django](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap-test-assets/tree/master/django)
